# InterWork Alliance Toolkit

The Token Taxonomy Framework bridges the gap between blockchain developers, line of business executives and legal/regulators allowing them to work together to model existing and define new business models and networks based on tokens. 

The framework's goals include - 

Define a common set of concepts and terms that can be used by business, technical, and regulatory participants to speak the same language.

Produce token definitions that have clear and understood requirements that are implementation neutral for developers to follow and standards organizations to validate.

Establish a base Token Classification Hierarchy (TCH) driven by metadata that is simple to understand and navigate for anyone interested in learning and discovering Tokens and underlying implementations.

The IWA Toolkit has been developed to - 

Deliver tooling meta-data using the TTF syntax that enables the generation of visual representations of classifications, and modelling tools to view and create token definitions mapped to the taxonomy.

Produce standard artifacts and control message descriptions mapped to the taxonomy that are implementation neutral and provide base components and controls that consortia, startups, platforms or regulators can use to work together.

Encourage differentiation and vertical specialization while maintaining an interoperable base.

Include a sandbox environment for legal and regulatory requirement discovery and input

Be used in taxonomy workshops for defining existing or new tokens which results in a contribution back to the framework to organically grow and expand across industries for maximum re-use.
